*What is the Working Open Workshop?*

The Working Open Workshop (or WOW) is a set of trainings to help up-and-coming people who lead open science projects prepare for a strong project launch on Collaborate (our platform for open source work) and a wildly successful local and Global Sprints on their project.

*What happens at WOW?*

WOW kicks off with a community event/mixer for project leads, potential contributors, citizen scientists, study group participants,  local like-minded organizations, and really anyone who’s curious about open research. The first iteration of this event features lightning talks by our Fellows and other key community members.

The core WOW experience is 2 days of small, invite-only workshops and work sessions led by Mozilla staff and Fellows, aimed at providing the skills and structure to get contributor-friendly open research projects up and running. In these workshops, we’ll cover the essentials of preparing an open project, bringing on contributors, using collaboration tools such as Git and GitHub, and growing an active community around an open project. 

Our approach is hands-on, and project-based: the WOW agenda includes lots of time for participants to do real, meaningful work on their projects. WOW is also designed 

The first WOW will be held in Berlin in early February 2016.
